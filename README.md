## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Before running the application, you'll need to set up your environment variables. Genkit uses these to connect to the Google AI services.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
3. Add the following line to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Genkit Server** (for AI features):
   In a separate terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npm run genkit:watch
   ```
   This will start the Genkit development server and watch for changes in your AI flows.

2. **Start the Next.js Development Server**:
   In another terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
